# COVID-19 Mapping Project

## Introduction

This lab comprises of two thematic maps: a choropleth map and a proportional symbols map. The choropleth map visualizes COVID-19 rates, providing insights into areas with higher infection rates. Meanwhile, the proportional symbols map represents COVID-19 cases through interactive symbols, allowing users to explore case numbers in different locations. This lab aims to provide a visual narrative of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact across the United States.
